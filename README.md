Active Record Pattern:

Combines business logic and data persistence in a single object.
Popularized by Martin Fowler and Ruby on Rails.
Simplifies CRUD operations but can lead to bloated models.


Repository Pattern:

Separates business logic from data persistence.
Centralizes query construction and promotes modularity.
Enhances scalability, flexibility, and testability.
Suitable for complex domains with evolving business rules.


Choosing the Right Pattern:

Active Record: Ideal for simple applications with minimal business logic.
Repository: Best for complex, scalable applications requiring flexibility and clear separation of concerns.
